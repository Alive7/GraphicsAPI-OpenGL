# GraphicsAPI-OpenGL

An elementary graphics api providing native 2D and 3D model primatives, texturing, elementary lighting, and model loading. Based off the tutorial by Joey de Vries found at https://learnopengl.com/

This update likely breaks compatibility with my NBodySimulation repo and the provided MakeFile.

Compilation requires GFLW, glad, and stbi amoung other dependances as outlined in LearnOpenGL.
