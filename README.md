# OpenGL-Libs

A simple collection of OpenGL headers providing basic graphics functions. This library is based off the tutorial by Joey de Vries found at https://learnopengl.com/

To interface with my NBodySimulation repository, simply include the NSim.h header and add the TreeGraphics.cc functions to source.cpp.
