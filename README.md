# OpenGL-Libs

A simple collection of OpenGL headers providing basic graphics functions. This library is based off the tutorial by Joey de Vries found at https://learnopengl.com/

To interface with my NBodySimulation repository, include the NSim.h header and add the TreeGraphics.cc functions to source.cpp.

I have attempted to include a Makefile. It should be able to compile both OpenGL and NSim together although some mosification might be needed based on your specific directory structure. Moreover, glfw may or may not compile correctly.
